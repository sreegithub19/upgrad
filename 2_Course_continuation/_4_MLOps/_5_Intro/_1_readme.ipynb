    "The different phases of the life cycle are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "ML development: This phase involves rapid experimentation to select a suitable model with the end goal of creating a baseline model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training operationalisation: This involves converting useful code from a Jupyter Notebook to Python scripts for optimisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous training: This involves automating the training process so that it can be trained automatically whenever live data comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model deployment: This phase involves the actual deployment of the model by creating an inference pipeline and through continuous integration and deployment of the same pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction serving: This phase usually involves creating APIs to deliver the model predictions to the end user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous monitoring: In this phase, we constantly monitor the modelâ€™s performance to continuously integrate and deploy any changes required due to model/concept drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data and model management: This part talks about choosing the correct infrastructure to ensure the security of data and models."
