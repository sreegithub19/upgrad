    "1. git branch -m main: \n",
    "\n",
    "It will create another branch called ‘main’ and you will be directed to the main branch. If you type git branch after executing the above command, you will notice that your current branch has been changed from master to main. \n",

    "\n",
    "2. ‘git reset’ goes back to the commit id that is mentioned and all the commits after that are erased. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. ‘git revert’ will create another commit that shows that you are reverting back to the previous commit. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "4. A Histogram plots the frequency of a numeric variable, whereas the Bar plot shows the aggregation of a certain numerical entity for some categorical variable. In Situation A, you are analysing the total sum of runs, which is a numeric variable for all the teams, which is a categorical variable. Hence it will need a bar plot. For Situation B, you're understanding the spread of a numeric variable by checking the frequency. Hence a histogram will be used here. \n",
